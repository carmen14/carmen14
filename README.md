I'm a telecommunications engineer specialized in electronic systems (Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from the University of Vigo). I also hold a second Master’s degree in astronomy and astrophysics from the International University of Valencia, and I’m currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Luxembourg, focused on edge computing and machine learning applications for space systems. Professionally, I have worked as a space systems engineer at Alén Space, contributing to CubeSat missions. Currently, I'm involved in several R&D activities at CERN.

Beyond work, I'm a young space enthusiast with a lifelong dream of becoming an astronaut. I'm passionate about music, I play drums and guitar, and I plan to learn piano and violin in the future. I'm an adventurous person, I spend most weekends hiking in the Alps or paragliding. I've practiced judo since the age of 3 (hold a black belt) and have won numerous competitions. I also enjoy via ferrata, climbing and scuba diving along the coast of Vigo.
